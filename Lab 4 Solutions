Question 1

Randomly generate a series of solutions (example 10 random solutions indicating the rows and columns each Queen is in).
Check the fitness score of each solution; it is very likely that some share rows, columns or diagonals.
In this case the fitness score is the sum of possiblities that a queen can attack another
The aim is a fitness score of 0, any higher is a fail. Then, take the 2 solutions with the lowest fitness scores
and apply crossover and mutation. There are 8 values in each solution so take the crossover point as 4:
- create Child 1 by combining the first half of Parent 1 and the second half of Parent 2
- create Child 2 by combining the first half of Parent 2 and the second half of Parent 1
- Apply mutation to each Child by changing one column with a random value between 0 and 7
Then assess the fitness scores of each Child to see if its better than either of its parents.
Add the Children back to the initial pool of solutions and repeat the process until a fitness score of 0 is attained.
